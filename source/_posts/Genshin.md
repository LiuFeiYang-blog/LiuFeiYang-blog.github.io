# The best ratio between CRIT rate and CRIT damage in Genshin Impact(updating)

## 1. ABSTRACT

  This article was only researched the best ratio of CRIT rate (record as p) and CRIT damage(record as r), which means ignoring the influence of  ATK, element mastery, etc.  Actually,  the other factors may have a higher damage yield than CRIT sometimes, therefore, the result does not talk about the priority of each factor.  Moreover, we considered the single character without any buffs and the effect of the individual operation. 

  In players' consciousness, CRIT rate : CRIT damage = 1 : 2can gain the maximum damage expectation which is an experienced conclusion. However, it only was appropriate for multiple attacks. the actual damage will be deflected when the attack times decreased. So,Ii converted the expectation to two meaningful points

1. *the time you need to complete the challenge*(in the domain battle)
2. *the number of times you need to complete the challenge* (in the spiral abyss)

  Someone may say, the high DPS, the lower time you need. The higher CRIT damage, the greater opportunities to overcome the challenge. BUT I wanted to find accurate and quantitative relations between them, even some of results were against common sense OR looks unnecessary.
